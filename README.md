# Social VR: Let's have a chat!
A social VR platform supporting VoIP and hand motion capture developed for my BSc thesis.

## Technologies

- [Mirror](https://github.com/vis2k/Mirror "Mirror's github Repository") (Unity networking API)
- [CaptoGlove](https://www.captoglove.com/ "CaptoGlove's Homepage") (motion capture glove)
- [UniVoice](https://github.com/adrenak/UniVoice "UniVoice's github Repository") (Unity VoIP solution, modified source code to work with Mirror)

## TODO

- VR UI.
- Replace Telepathy networking layer with Ignorance.

### Luxury:

- Mouth, lip syncing.

### Quality of Life:
